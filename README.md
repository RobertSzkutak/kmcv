K-Means Clustering Visualizer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project uses the K-Means Clustering algorithm to cluster points and then draws the resulting clusters.

*Build Instructions:*
Relies on SDL along with the C and C++ Standard Libraries. Just run make on Linux systems. It should be trivial to build on a Windows system or various embedded Linux based  platforms.

*Usage:*
For clustering random points: Just modify the #define statements at the top of the code. Then in main run randomPoints();

For clustering points from a file: Format points as such:
x,y\n
x,y\n
etc.
